# About SingleStore

SingleStore is a distributed, relational database that handles both transactions and real-time analytics at scale. Querying is done through standard SQL drivers and syntax, leveraging a broad ecosystem of drivers and applications.

We have been building SingleStore since 2011, and building a database-as-a-service product involves a bunch of interesting technical challenges such as:
* Compilers and code generation
* Distributed computing and fault tolerance
* UI and User Experience
* Integrations with connectors and third-party tools (e.g., Business Intelligence tools like Tableau)
* Infrastructure that scales to dozens of thousands of database clusters across GCP, Azure and AWS

Our Engineering organization is distributed across various countries, with a lot of us working remotely. In this repository, we keep a list of open positions and we're also happy to take any questions you have for our Engineering team!
